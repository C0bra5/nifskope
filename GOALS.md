# Contents of the file
This file details some goals I'd like to achieve while working on this project.
It's unlikely I'll complete all of them; but hey I like writing down my ideas.

## Adding documentation
It would be nice to have some extra documentation for future developers.

## Moving configuration data to a file
While using registry keys is nice and all, the settings don't port over between
versions and that's an issue. It also makes it easier to edit if you know what
you are doing.

Since we can already parse XML consider using that.

## Simplifying the way BSA archives are identified
It took 20 minutes to launch Nif Skope when I had my settings cleared because of
the version shenanigans. This is caused by the large amount of files in my
fallout 4 folder. We should look into fixing that.

## Making it so that you can select BSConnectionPoints in the 3d view.
Adding some functionality to select those things around more easily would be very nice.

It should probably work like the method used for selecting bone nodes.

## Adding some spells to reorganize array rows.
It would be nice to group them up so I can more effectively tell what is what.

## Adding the ability to move/rotate/scale things in the 3d view.
IDK how to do this, but I would love to be able to use the 3d view to move things
instead of having to edit the values in the block details.
